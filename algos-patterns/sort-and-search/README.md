# INFO

This suite represents a collection of algorithms for the following operations:

1. Find largest or smallest element: normal search on array -> linear time complexity
2. Fully order an array: Quicksort with pivot -> NlogN time complexity
3. Find the kth largest or smallest element in an unordered array: Hoare Quickselect with pivot -> N time complexity
