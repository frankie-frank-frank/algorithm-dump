//the solution must be an interactive terminal:
//Once it displays "hello there", it runs the program in the following steps:
//a: immediately call quicksort
//b. ask user for word input
//c. construct the binary tree
//d. if word does not exist, send null
//e. otherwise, cache the binary tree with its values by storing its details in another thread
//f. on the second time the user asks for the word, immediately fetch from the tree
//NOTE: you do not need to worry about any other directories or files. I am making the assumption that the user is already in that particular folder
