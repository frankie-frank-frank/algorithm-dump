    "explanation": "This error message is telling you that there is a security issue with your webpage. It means that a part of your website is trying to access another part of the website, but it is being blocked because of security restrictions. This is happening because one part of the website is in a type of security mode called a sandbox, which doesn't allow it to interact with other parts of the website without special permission. The error message is essentially saying that the sandboxed part of the website is trying to break out of its restricted mode, but it is being prevented from doing so to protect the website from potential security threats. This issue will need to be addressed by adjusting the security settings on your website to ensure that all parts can work together safely.",

    "explanation": "This message is telling you that there is a problem with the way a certain function is defined on your webpage. It is saying that the function 'OneSignal' has already been defined in a conflicting way. To fix this issue, you need to specify how 'OneSignal' should be defined so that it works correctly. You can do this by adding 'window.OneSignal = window.OneSignal || [];' in your webpage's console with a severity level of SEVERE. This will ensure that 'OneSignal' is defined properly and resolves any conflicts that may be causing issues on your webpage. It's important to address this problem to ensure that your webpage functions properly.",
